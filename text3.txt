Introduction
------------
With the growth in popularity of the IBM PC pinball game, Android, and its 
many requests for cheat keys, I decided to put this Frequently Asked Questions 
document (FAQ) together.  Please e-mail ngsippel@miavx2.ham.muohio.edu with 
any comments, questions, or additions.

As of Friday April 15, 1994, the FAQ Server at news-answers-request@mit.edu 
will be posting this document in the middle of every month.

NOTE: Unless there is a major revision of Android (which is rumored) or a 
super secret is found, I will not be putting out anymore revisions after this 
one.  If there is a new edition or revision or someone wants me to add their 
trick, I will update this FAQ.

This edition, I am adding a strategy section.  Please send in, if you wish, 
your best strategies.  (They will be added along with your name next to it.)

The biggest FAQ is "how do I hit the physical systems consistently?"  I have 
yet to come up with a solid solution, so one would be very much appreciated by 
all!  (I tried in this edition!:)


I. What is Android Pinball?

"Android" is one of Epic Megagames' new pinball tables.  This FAQ covers the 
shareware version of Android which is available all over the Internet (and 
other networks).  Remember: Android is shareware; if you like it, please pay 
for it.  Thank you.

II. Where can I get a copy of Android?

One can download it from any major FTP site.  Archie can find FTP sites with 
it using the filename search of "0pinball.zip."  Here are a few places to look 
(from a recent archie search):

Host athene.uni-paderborn.de

    Location: /pcsoft2/msdos2/games/Epic
           FILE -rw-r--r--     707185  Nov  1 14:49  0pinball.zip

Host gandalf.umcs.maine.edu

    Location: /pub/msdos/games
           FILE -rw-------     707185  Dec  8 04:34  0pinball.zip


III. What are Android's keyboard controls?

Key            Function
------------------------------------------------------------
Space Bar      Shoot the ball, Tilt the pinball machine up
Left Arrow     Flip up the left flipper
Left Shift     Flip up the left flipper
Right Arrow    Shoot the ball, Flip up right flipper
Right Shift    Flip up the right flipper
Up Arrow       Scroll pinball machine viewing area up
Down Arrow     Scroll pinball machine viewing area down
M              Turn music on/off
P              Pause
S              Turn sound on/off
T              Adjust tracking (smoothness) control
Z              Tilt the machine right
/              Tilt the machine left
ESCape         Quit (Y/N)?

See "What are its secrets?" for cheat keys! :)


IV. What are its missions and goals?

Here are the three goals of the game:

[1] Hit the physical systems hole once to start activating the systems.
    Every time you hit all three targets, aim for the hole again to
    activate an arm, a leg, or other body part.  Once you finish the torso,
    there are no more systems to activate.  Collect Tests every time you
    activate an android part.

Physical Stages: (Note: All "M"s after numbers stand for million)
  Hit all three targets (marked 1, 2, 3) and physical stage hole to activate
    Left Arm
    Right Arm (Multiball & Jackpot)
    Left Leg
    Right Leg (Multiball & Jackpot)
    Head
    Torso (Multiball with 3 balls and Double Jackpot; Testing max is 247M)

[2] Move the ball through the rightmost ramp to activate the computer link.
    Every time you complete the targets, hit through the regular left ramp
    to get memory (5M, 10M, 15M, etc).  Once you complete all 3 targets,
    you can get BOTH goals [1] and [2], and then it resets.

Memory Stages:
  Basic Input/Output (I/O)
    5M - Start computer link-up and aim for all ramps

  Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    10M - Aim for all ramps and targets
    15M (Virus) - Hit rightmost ramp

  Artificial Intelligence 2 (AI2)
    20M - Shoot all red triangle paths

  Database
    35M - Sink the pinball into all the sink-holes
    15M (Virus) - Hit rightmost ramp

  Activate
    Hit all three targets on the board (the 1, 2, and 3 switches)

[3] Collect points and jackpots.

Collecting Points:

There are many "points only" targets on the board such as the "Power Up" hole. 
Every time this hole is hit, one letter lights up at the bottom of the board 
(such as "P" or "W"); once all ten letters are lit, a jackpot of 10 million is 
awarded.  Another score-booster is aiming for the ramp that leads to the 
bumpers, and the red arrow for the middle lights begins glowing.  When this 
ramp is traveled, the ramp pot increases by thirty thousand and the current 
pot is awarded.  Another target is the IQ--IQ will never reach a maximum.  My 
personal high for IQ was 1100.

Multiball Stages and Jackpots:

After completing the arms, multiball (with two pinballs) will appear.  Aim for 
the second left-most lane (not the test lane or the return-to-the-bottom ramp) 
which will give the jackpot plus highlight the middle ramp's bonus.  After 
completing the legs, a similar multiball will occur.  Once the torso is 
activated, the final multiball will drop its three pinballs in the middle of 
the board.  Aim for the test lane for double jackpot.

Other Notes of Interest:

A. The middle ramp's bonus value starts at 100,000 and increases every time by 
30,000 when the ramp is lit.  (See "How do I hit ... ?" section for more 
information on the middle ramp.)

B. Fast PCs have silver flippers, and slow PCs have yellow flippers.  This can 
be switched in the OPTIONS menu.

C. Angles make the ball lighter or heavier.  Low angles for lightweight 
pinballs or high angles for heavyweight pinballs.

From Mike Brandt (mobrandt@mailbox.syr.edu):
  Actually, the angle refers to the slope of the virtual pinball
  table relative to horizontal. The physics is different from that
  of lighter/heavier balls. For example, on a given slope, balls
  with different weights will accelerate at the same rate. But 
  changing the slope changes the acceleration.


V. How do I hit ... ? (Strategy Section)

    ... the Physical Systems Hole?

The best method I've found is to let the ball go through the left ramp and 
come down to the left flipper.  When it lands on the very edge of the 
flipper's tip, flip up, and it should go in about 50% of the time.

    ... the Power Hole?

Similar to the physical systems except that it should be in the middle of the 
left flipper.  After it leaves the hole, let it touch (for about a second) the 
flipper, and flip the ball up again.

    ... the Test Hole or Drop Targets?

Flip the pinball up through the middle ramp and let it land on your right 
flipper.  When it gets close to the tip, flip up, and it should head in the 
direction of the hole/targets.

    ... the Bumpers (more often after it is shot up)?

When the pinball is heading back down to the center of the board after 
bouncing around the bumpers, hit the Space Bar to shake the pinball machine.  
This will cause the ball to bounce around more and rack up IQ points.

    ... the Middle Ramp's light on?

Flip the pinball to the middle lane; this will activate the middle ramp's 
bonus.  After the initial 100 grand, the bonus increases by 30,000.


VI. What are its secrets?

To get an extra ball before playing, press F1 at the OPTIONS screen at the 
number of balls choice.  (See the extra pages in the help.)

These are not officially from Epic Megagames, but these debug codes in the 
shareware version will help you have some fun with the game.  All codes need 
to have escape (ESC) to be pressed first for the prompt; the responses to this 
prompt activates the cheats.  (The escape is included for quick reference.)

Codes      Purpose                                 Debug Purpose (theoretical)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         The best cheats of the game:

ESC-B-N    * An extra ball is dropped during play. Test multiball.

ESC-J      + Using the cursor keys, the ball is    Test whole game and goals.
           under player control.

                           Interesting debug codes:

ESC-F9     A border appears.                       ? ? ? ?
           (Does not work for all monitors.)

ESC-F10    A screen capture to file SCREEN.PCX.    Advertising Purposes

ESC-F1     A parameter request prompt.             ? ? ? ?
           (Unknown parameters)

Footnotes from Mike Brandt (mobrandt@mailbox.syr.edu):
  * This works on all tables in the registered version, except
    for Engima which crashes (albeit in a very colorful way)
  + This does not work on the registered version, including Android.

I have tested out all other keys, so there are no more ESC-(button) debug 
codes.  However, the ESC-F1 looks to be promising research material.

Other means of free balls:

DISCLAIMER: I do not recommend changing any of the files on pinball except 
when the Set-Up Program changes it.  Use at your own risk!!

From Steve Hastings (steveha@microsoft.com):
  A good cheat you didn't mention: make a backup copy of the options 
  file.  Then change the number of balls. Then run "comp" or some similar 
  utility on the backed-up options file versus the current options file; 
  you will get a message that one byte is different, and the offset of 
  the byte.  Now use Norton Utilities or any other binary editor to patch 
  that one byte to a value of zero.  Presto: an unlimited number of 
  balls.  The ball counter will max-out at 9 and stay there, and you can 
  play forever.  I think I had a 5-digit IQ once when I was trying to get 
  past "Torso" to the next level.  I'll be bummed if there isn't one.

From Mike Brandt (mobrandt@mailbox.syr.edu):
  Here is a QBASIC program which accomplishes the "edit the options
  file" cheat. Just run QBASIC (which comes with DOS versions 5 and
  up), type in the following program, and choose RUN from the menu.

   OPEN "C:\PINBALL\CONFIG.PIN" FOR BINARY AS #1
   A$ = CHR$(0)
   PUT #1, 12, A$
   CLOSE #1

  Substitute the path that you have Epic Pinball in, if it isn't
  C:\PINBALL, in the first line. You can also change the zero in
  the second line to a number from 1 to 9 to set the number of 
  balls per game (the Zero makes it infinite.)

Balls Executable Program:
There is a program out on the ftp sites called "balls.c" and/or "balls.exe".  
It will give you unlimited balls, and it is rumored to be written by Epic 
Megagames.  The first two methods are dangerous because I'm not sure if they 
are copyright violations.  I would like to include the balls.exe file in 
uuencoded format, but I would like to find out from the powers that be.  Who's 
right about changing the files?  Who's wrong?  I am waiting for Epic 
Megagames' response to my e-mails.  My friend Darren has some comments on it:

From Darren 'The Hammer' Carlson (carlson@calvin.assiniboinec.mb.ca): 
  I think the FAQ is quite good. I wasn't aware of the debug codes that were
  available in the game.

  I can't see why you wouldn't be able to distribute the compiled code for 
  Balls.exe with the FAQ. Epic has the file in its Hints & Cheats Library on
  Compuserve in their Forum. I don't remember there being a note about not
  being able to distribute it but I may be wrong. I'll post a message in the
  Forum and see what the powers that be say about it.

Here is yet another viewpoint about the file changing:

From Mike Brandt (mobrandt@mailbox.syr.edu):
  I noticed that you mentioned this in your FAQ; I find it quite
  surprising. After all, I bought the program from Epic, and I
  feel that I have the right to modify any of its files if I so
  desire; I have no intention of giving any of the files (modified
  or not) to anybody else. I will check Epic's licensing agreement.
  I do believe that you're not allowed to modify the shareware
  version *and then pass it on*, but modifying for your own use?

  Anyway, even if it is a copyright violation to modify the file,
  it should be ok to describe how it's done. (For example, growing
  pot is illegal, but I've seen _The Marijuana Grower's Guide_ in
  bookstores!) Just add a disclaimer. (I did add a disclaimer -- Ed.)
